The Every Realm is the intersection of all planes of reality. Specifically my realities: things that I think about, things that I perceive, or things that I witness. 

Throughout life I’ve come across many different threads that piqued my interest, but none that truly held itself apart from the others. And because of my lack of organization - my knack for keeping everything inside my head - I haven’t made as much progress sewing up these threads as I’d like. It turns out getting older is as lame as everyone warned: I seem to be forgetting more and more of my not-quite-brilliant ideas from the past… and I need a record of some of the better ones.

I have grand schemes and plots to hatch and the Every Realm will birth it all. I decided to work on projects in a timely and organized fashion; progress in these domains will appear here periodically. The first grand scheme was simply getting this site up and running.

In addition, it is fun to write things to nobody in particular. I dislike the word blog, but that’s what this site will start as. Hopefully I can entertain you, and otherwise just give poor advice that you should follow [blindly] anyways.

But enough about the site… what about *me*? Who am I? 24601?

I am Panarchus. Ruler of the Pandominion (original name for the Every Realm that I am still fond of) and the pandemonium that incites it. I am a Software Engineer by trade, a bum by nature, and a philosopher by default. I enjoy both doing and not doing. Let’s see what time enjoys doing [through me].
