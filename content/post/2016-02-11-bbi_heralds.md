Anyone who has read Homer knows what epithets are: long-winded, comma-strewn, title-chaining combinations of words that dubiously describe a character and precede any mention to said character if they have been gone for any more than five minutes. Much like the prior statement, they tend to get out of hand and can be difficult to even parse. More text was used in the Iliad for epithets than actual characters doing things (*citation needed*)! Here are some examples:<!--more-->

Odysseus:

- Zeus’ equal in his mind’s resource
- sacker of cities
- nimble-witted

Achilles:

- lion-hearted
- swift-footed
- like to the gods

Chain them together for extra the juice:

> The lion-hearted, swift-footed, like to the gods, Achilles is in the lieu.

They’re ridiculous and outlandish; they’re absolutely fantastic and I love them.

Parties would be a lot better if people had epithets and a way to announce themselves as if entering a Victorian ball. For this purpose we need **Heralds** and an app like Uber that allows you to call upon a registered Herald to follow you around. Your hired follower would remain silent while you remain in a room, speaking only upon you breaching a threshold. Imagine walking into a party and having your personal herald-for-an-evening announce raucously you to the crowd: 

> All welcome the ruler of nothing, the lazy bum of Chandler Street, the mustachioed-man who plays soccer in his free time: Panarchus!

No longer would you have to introduce yourself three-thousand times per night, and the proverbial ice will be broken for all attendees. If someone is interested in mustaches or commiserating in sloth they know who to talk to. The better your herald, the more friends you’ll make.

It does get a little precarious when trying to sneak off for some nefarious, romantic deeds… and more than a little awkward to be followed everywhere you go. But I definitely believe the benefits outweigh these issues. You may even wind up with a couple new titles under your belt:

- sloppy kisser
- minuteman
- smelly-stepper
- projectile vomiter of six-and-a-half feet

As a part of the Herald app, you would have a profile with all of these epithets available. The Herald can then easily randomize your titles and have a different order/selection each time you enter a new room. Integrate with Facebook and your buddies can find your epithets to read for their own amusement on their own time. Allow friends, enemies, and ex-lovers to create epithets for you: what could possibly go wrong? Add in “likes” and other ubiquitous social media nonsense to make algorithm heuristics. Use Bluetooth to keep track of a history of epithet-ers that were near you, in case you have short-term memory loss. Then comes the crucial fork in the road: use ratings for human heralds (like Uber) or have your phone/tablet just be your herald for you… (if going the Uber route: start work on Herald-robots. Call ‘em *Heroids*... or not, that’s awful).

Clearly there is a bottomless pool of potential for this app. Here are some other great additions:

- Allow epithets to integrate with Facebook, Google+, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc… in reverse! (ie: let epithets be viewable from these other apps. I especially like the distinct advantage having ‘satan incarnate’ preceding your name on LinkedIn provides you in the job marketplace)
- A Venmo-esque/global/public feed of newly created epithets (hopefully with rich descriptions of how they came about)
- Auto-tweets of the above to followers
- Tagging: see who else out there is a “quick guzzler”
- GPS/location-based history, for when you don’t remember where or how you became the “clumsy kneader”
- Automated app-to-speaker binding. Have the whole party be notified via the surround sound who just walked in! No need for robots, hired heralds, or wimpy smartphone speakers.
- Unique Herald groups/profiles: allow Heralds to specify why they are superior to the robots and your phones/speaker-systems:
  - They have a sick accent
  - They dress up in drag
  - They double as a great wing(wo)man
  - Somebody to talk to when your randomized epithets immediately cause everyone else in your near vicinity to quickly disperse
  - Additional pampering for extra fees
  - No tip required!
  - Additional tip required!

At this point the point is made. I could continue to point out other pointers to the greatness of the Herald app, but any astute reader will have pointedly understood the nuances of all the prior points. Unfortunately, as one of my epithets clearly stated, I am a bum. The idea is up-for-grabs, free of charge! It’s up to you - *points through monitor at everyone in particular* - to make it happen.

Cheers,

Point-out-er of grand ideas, Panarchus
