The other day (or month, whatever, *Time*, nobody likes you) my girlfriend and I watched a movie. It was ok. Honestly I’m not sure which movie it was though I’m pretty sure it had to be either:

* The Hateful Eight, or
* The Revenant

I’m not here to review them but suffice it to say that I probably will not see them again anytime soon\*. This isn’t really about those movies anywho.<!--more--> So… we finished watching one at the theatre on a Friday night (y’know, it must’ve been the Revenant because I remember now that the Hateful Eight was so long we had to skip out on work a wee bit early in order watch it on a Wednesday{{% fnote %}}Like **delinquent badasses**. I mean, like **responsible adults**. I mean… like probably neither of those things.{{% /fnote %}}) and it was 9pm or so. We’re reasonably young, hip people and thought

> Hey, you think any of our other reasonably young, hip friends would be down to chill at one of these conveniently-located-yet-indistinguishable-from-each-other bars near us?

> Oh, of course, that sounds like a good plan! Who should we invite?

> …

> …

(alright, so, it was more speaking and less strictly thinking)

> How about group A?

(we totally don’t categorize our friends into groups labelled with letters… promise...)

> Yeah, sure. You wanna send a group text?

> Hmmm… or maybe group B? A little mixture of both? I know a lot of peeps in group A are busy-ish tonight…

> Oh yeah, you’re right. Well, invite whoever you want!

> …

This went on for awhile. In the end we decided to send out a simple group text and at worst have an impromptu date.

Nobody showed{{% fnote %}}**WE ARE BORN ALONE AND WE WILL DIE ALONE AND IN THE MIDDLE...WE WILL DRINK ALONE**{{% /fnote %}}.

But we got to talking: how cool would it be if there was an app that let you simply send out a broadcast to select circles of friends with a one-line invite, or default simply to

> Join me @ \<place\>! I’ll be there from \<start time\> to \<end time\>

? You could set up your *cough* - circles - in advance, and then easily select different circles to send the invite to. Integrate it with something that has… circles… to make it even easier. Or with Facebook - since people actually use that{{% fnote "[+]" %}}Allegedly. I have no problem with Google+ myself, of course, so please don’t drop my page rank!{{% /fnote %}} - and making them yourself could be very simple. You just want close friends to come over while you’re grilling? Cool. You going out and want to see anybody and everybody you’ve ever met and/or seen? Cool, no problem! You want to invite everyone you’ve never met, every strang-o and weird-er? Hmm… alright, I’ll allow it. It could be used for a random meetup like so, while constraints could be set geographically. Or something. Moving on...

The app would ping users in your selected circles letting them know when and where you are. It would keep track of upcoming (I’m thinking limited to the next 24 hours; sort of an impromptu pseudo-event planner) pings as well. You can have it notify you only when people within a certain degree of friendship (ie circle/group) sends out a ping, or simply have it ping you all the time. Ping. Ping. Ping{{% fnote "[+]" %}}Pong. Pong. Pong.{{% /fnote %}}.

I’m actually pretty sure apps like these exist already, but since I don’t have them they obviously aren’t meeting my demands accurately. I think this idea is simple and has merit and can be implemented rather easily. It’s something I may try as an upcoming project… unless someone out there beats me to the punch!

Additionally, it would be super cool if the app had awesome voice control powers. That would make it 10x as easy to be lazy when creating your Join Me! event. Someone give me a better name, please...

It reminds me of an idea my brother and I had at a [**beer fest**]({{< ref "post/2016-02-08-bbi_beer_fests.md" >}}) once upon a time… only I think that idea was a wee bit… stranger. If I recall we decided a good name for it would be Flockr, but I think that deserves its own post (with a chance for some co-authoring).

I plan on revisiting this in the future: let me know if you have cool, related ideas that I can steal.

Cheers,

Panarchus


\* I lied, here is my official review(s): both movies were reasonably good and definitely entertaining. The gore in the Revenant actually bothered me a little more than the gore in the Hateful Eight, because it was far less ridiculous. Not that gore bothers, really. I felt both movies didn’t have much substance to them; perhaps they just had little… point? Direction? They're lacking imagination. I liked both fine, but there are so many good films/shows to watch and no reason to devote time to watching these again in the foreseeable future. Good acting, though. These are all my thoughts. That’s part of the problem.
