Greetings travelers,

Welcome to the crossroads of my intersecting interests. It is here that newly born ideas will be inscribed into the memory of the inter-webs, nevermore to be lost among the continuous flux of crud Time doth dote upon my mind.

Here I shall at least mention, probably detail, and preferably implement these thoughts. At least the better, non-cruddy ones. Here I shall foray into the various Realms that intrigue me (Every Realm [that matters]) and bring back experience, at the very least. It might be worthwhile, it might make me vomit; it will be.

> Forge on!

I say to me, and: <!--more-->

Sincerely,

Panarchus
Ruler of all I/O @ Every Realm
