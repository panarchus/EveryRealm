Like most sane humans I enjoy drinking copious amounts of beer. The microbrewery upheaval in recent times has served me well: my taste buds rejoice, my stress wanes, and my waist broadens. Over the past several years I have been an avid attendee to various brew fests (define:brew fest: an organized event where people congregate to enjoy alcoholic beverages dispensed by local breweries - specifically beer and cider - in excess, while mingling and general good times are had). As the definition implies I have had many a merry time and I have become accustomed to the beer scene in my neck of the greater-worldly-woods. I have thought about how to reach those breweries that are more selective and rare - the ones that are perhaps too small or too busy or too uppity/hipster/annoying to distribute across state lines (or better yet: directly into my hands) - and as is customary, ideas emerge… <!--more-->


### Idea 1: Multi-brewery Road-trip Extravaganzas

There are so many breweries/beers I want to check out in my 3-hour radius. I mentioned to my friend that we should take a road trip, simply visiting all the breweries and tasting their finest, freshest, most Untappd-worthy beers before moving along to the next one. We could make a weekend out of it. There were some slight issues…

-  How are we going to drive around and drink all day?
-  Where are we going to sleep?
-  What if the breweries aren’t open?
-  “That’s a lot of gas money” (similarly: “We don’t own a car”)

All fair points. Namely the first one though, as the others have readily-available solutions. Then we got to thinking: what if we made a business out of this? We could run a brewery-bus to travel between breweries, drinking along the way if when necessary, and we could even make deals and talk with the breweries themselves to set up deals and other opportunities. Chooo-choooo! Sign me up for the next beer bus! ...of course this wouldn’t solve our immediate problem: thirst. And it would require an awful lot of work… and capital… and who knows if anyone besides us would even be interested? What we really need is…


### Idea 2: The Pub
You know pubs, right, where people come gather after a hard, mind-scrapingly-boring day of work to sit down and drink a pint or four? You know those places? What I’m imagining is a place a whole lot… like that. However, instead of your usual selection of domestics and the occasional brew from the occasional local brewery, my pub would be full of micros from all over a wide area. No bottles either, only draught. I’m thinking that instead of a bus, we have a semi go around and pick up new kegs of new beers from a bunch of brewers and deliver it back to our pub each week. I want fresh, eclectic, and sometimes downright unfortunate experiments winding their way to me. Every tap is rotating, get it while it lasts! ...Unfortunately we run into some of the same problems: requires a lot of work, capital, and risk. And doesn’t solve that immediate issue! I’m fucking thirsty! But it’s a fun idea, and I like it quite a bit. It reminds me of the aforementioned beer fests, in a way: a nice gathering of different beers from many brewers where people can come together and get schwasted, muttering incoherencies about their palate and how this 34% beer tastes purrrrrrrty good. A little sweet, but I think it’s offset by the fact that I’M FUCKING DRRRRRRUNK.

…

Which got me thinking…

### Idea 3: The Pub [Open Weekends **only** for an Explosion of Pent-up Debauchery]
All this beer collection is going to take time, and probably be limited in quantity/availability. It would be easier to set up more organized/scheduled pickups with the breweries for their kegs on some weekly basis, and let’s be honest, the most popular moments to lose your mind are the weekends. This allows us extra time to advertise the beers that will be available too. And while we’re at it, since everyone is going to want to taste everything, why don’t we just have a gigantic cover and hand out tasting cups? ...ok so it’s just a beer fest at this point. But a weekly one! No longer will you have to wait for a month or two and hope your favorite brewer will swing by! No longer will you miss your chance to drink a limited time offering! No longer will you have to drive several hours to pay $50 for a growler or two! Now you can get it all here in one place, every weekend. Now for naming this great venue:

-  Trash Town
-  The Fellowship of Eclecticism
-  Every Realm Pub
-  Latrine Street
-  …

Alright, not the best names ever made, so if you have any better ones let me know. That said, this is never going to happen - by me, anyways - because at this point in the discussion that my buddy had the best idea yet:

### Idea 4: 
It is simple, yet satisfying. It’s a marvelous concept that will revolutionize the beer-drinking world. Just follow these simple steps:
Look up the Microbrews you’re interested in and see which ones are available near you (liquor stores).

1.  Go to those liquor stores.
2.  Buy the beer you want.
3.  Go home.
5.  Drink.

Boom, baby! A beer festival at home, for your convenience! You don’t even need to advertise it: just shoot an mass text off to some of your friends, acquaintances, coworkers, people-you’re-interested-in-talking-about-politics-and-religion-with, ex-girlfriends, whoever and they’ll all come parading down your street. If you’re really conniving, you can charge a cover to your abode, but remember to send me a royalty check!

**DISCLAIMER:** I’m far too lazy/poor to make any of the above (well, except that last one) happen but would definitely be a patron if someone else were to do all the heavy lifting. Make it happen!

Cheers,
Panarchus
