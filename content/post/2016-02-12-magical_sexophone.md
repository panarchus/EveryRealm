Several weeks ago I went to quite possibly the diviest bar/venue I have ever seen. Granted, I don't get out too these kind of places much, so take my view with a tablespoon of salted caramel smothered over a hot, puffy pretzel. The place is a bit out-of-the-way, across the street from a pub I visit very occasionally. It's unassuming with nothing note-worthy anywhere nearby; I had never noticed it before. I walked in with my friend who brought me along just before 4pm on a mild Saturday afternoon.<!--more-->

The floors were old, dark wood that reminded me of a fraternity house basement just after a party. It was well-worn from many steps, jumps, fallen instruments and faces, and probably more than a couple of scuffles. They only took cash. We were early and sat down at the bar, a long rectangular island that reached out towards the single doorway entrance. We turned our seats and watched as the first band arrived and prepped the stage, and I nursed my hangover from the previous night's escapades with some water and beer.

The crowd trickled in: a bunch of graduates from nearby universities, friends and even some parents of the band mates. I suspect the usual constituency is composed, generally, of more locals and a rougher crowd. Pretty much as expected for today, though. I also expected the bands to be reasonably good. I didn't expect to be blown away.

The first group that played was a trio: singer/guitarist, bassist, and drummer. Three good-looking guys (the drummer was clearly Asgardian) without too much flair, but with obvious presence. They played a singery-song-writery style with intricate melodies played over fantastic chord progressions. At some point during the shows, my buddy leaned over and said

> It's awesome they’re able to create such a full sound, as if there were more than just the three of them up there!

I agreed completely. They worked together so cleanly and easily, sounding like a single unit but with great depth. I'm no musician or audiophile or anything, but I know when I hear some stellar mixture of wavelengths resounding against my eardrums.

The second group... was a single guy (for a couple songs). He somehow managed to play some fascinating melodies on the guitar while simultaneously playing drums for two songs. It was pretty incredible. Then joined by two other band mates, he continued to play guitar and sang. These guys played funky stuff, reminding me a bit like a tamer RHCP sometimes. I liked it quite a bit. The bassist used a pick and played a sick, powerful solo. [**Here**](http://daeves.bandcamp.com/) is a link to *Daeves*.

I want to take a quick break here before I talk about [**BULLDOG**](http://getembulldog.com).

<br>

Okay, break over.

The group that we came to see followed. And they were preeeeety good. Here is their self-description:

> Bulldog is a five-piece lyric- and beat-driven jazz-rock band with pop, hiphop, and neosoul elements. Newly relocated to Boston, Bulldog formed in Amherst, Massachusetts in 2013. With strong influences from Hiatus Kaiyote, Robert Glasper, Little Dragon, St. Vincent, Portishead, Jeff Buckley, and Ween, the band’s sound ranges from singer songwriter to hiphop, to funk, even to experimental and free jazz. Bulldog thrives at the intersection of jazz and hiphop, of pop and experimental.

The singer/guitarist (Alec) from the first group showed up and played saxophone for Bulldog. I'm a little depressed that I'll never be as good at any single instrument as he is at (at least) three... You may have guessed from the post's title that I want to talk about the saxophone (or sexophone, as I'm going to call it). But first I want to throw in my quick review:

> Awesome, awesome, awesome.

Bulldog was able to keep the whole venue entranced for their hour's reign. Much like the first band, they played so well together that they sounded even more complex and deep - as if there were 10-15 people instead of 5. And that really is a cool feat. Their music had this quality that I'm unsure how to describe, but I'll try: it enveloped the crowd, lulled us into a space/time outside of reality; it created a bubble that we were all within and their sound reverberated off the the walls and came from every direction at once. There was a specific moment in which I became awake, realizing that the entire crowd had just lost themselves and were regaining consciousness along with me. And the music was building up, gradually, and the crowd became truly awake until everyone was waiting for it.

And then that sexophone turned on and fucked us. And we loved it. It screeched and hollered and burst that bubble we were trapped in and the crowd - and I with them - went insane. It was a surreal moment. I felt everyone thinking the same thing: we had been submerged without noticing, and then let to breathe again before suffocating. Except, y'know, without the bad imagery of death. We sucked in that air and were given life back, never noticing we had let it drift off without us.

The saxophone is a powerful instrument with the ability to make everyone a wee bit hot and bothered. I imagine Dionysus using it to create his harems and orgies and what-have-yous. While I sat there listening to its golden splendor I knew I had made a mistake aeons ago when I picked up drumsticks instead of settling on the Alto Sex Machine. What little did I know way back then... I wanted to be a punk when I could've been sex God. And ultimately I am neither, as I haven't picked up those drum sticks or quintessential bandana in the past decade. My buddy whispered to me after the specific song that shattered the crowd:

> I think I came in my pants when that sax came on.

I responded:

> I think everyone did...

And I decided right then to pick one of those saxes up for myself and create a living hell for my roommates via practice everyday. By the time I got home, the idea was abandoned.

Music is like that. It can have the most profound effect, latching on to all in its presence with its decadent tentacles, injecting dopamine straight into the bloodstream, and create a network between people that it plays like a puppet (or a fiddle). And then the feeling wanes and we go back to our daily grinds. But we remember how it kept us enthralled, how it teased us, and how it made us move and wiggle... and we write about it. Or we jump overboard and swim with it, relishing being a part of the ebb and flow, becoming a disciple.

It's obvious which I chose, though I plan to test the waters myself some day. I walked out of there feeling high and wondering when next my boots will tread on this old wooden floor.

Cheers,

Panarchus


PS - There was a fourth band to play: [**Spooky Ghosts**](http://spookyghosts.bandcamp.com/) who were also pretty phenomenal (from what I heard). I only stayed for one of their songs, unfortunately, as I was getting tired. They deserve mentioning as well though, as I really loved what little I heard.
