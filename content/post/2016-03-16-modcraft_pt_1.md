I like games: console games, computer games, board games, card games, **sports**, etc. I like them in all types (though specific games can be quite bad,{{< fnote >}}

A Short And Judgmental List of <em>Quite Bad</em> Games:<br>
 - Friends: The Trivia Game (which inexplicably resides in our closet)<br>
 - Baseball (note: this is my Editor, not me, do not feel offense though I have the same opinion)<br>
 - The Most Dangerous Game<br>
 - <strong>MONOPOLY</strong><br>

{{< /fnote >}} obviously) and have always been interested in making my own, especially of the video variety. In the interest of not becoming a<del>n indie developer</del> starving artist, I’m going to take a brief look at what makes a successful (small-ish) game:<!--more-->

### Case 1: [Minecraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft)

- Simple graphics
- Sandbox{{% fnote "[+]" %}}*define*: **sandbox** >

A large bin containing sand and kids. The sand usually permeates every pore and hair follicle on the kids, becoming impossible to remove. The sand may become ingested. Every perceived occurrence of the actual bins belongs to the same place in spacetime and wormholes pop up in various backyards throughout the worlds via the tendrils of Sandopus (Guardian of the Sand Realm).{{% /fnote %}}
- Ability for players to create <del>monstrosities</del> great things
- Open-ended
- Much more fun with more people
- Has the word ‘craft’ as a part of the name

### Case 2: [Terraria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraria)

- See: Minecraft (minus the ‘craft’)

### Case 3: [DotA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients){{< fnote "[+]" >}}Defense of the Ancients. A map created in the Warcraft III editor that became more popular than Warcraft III itself and spawned an entire genre of games (MOBA) that now make up a giant portion of all Competitive Gaming{{< /fnote >}}

- ...Addiction
- Ability for players to vocally hate on anything and everyone and otherwise form a wildfire of prepubescent rage (regardless of age of rager)
- Built as a mod on an engine of an AAA game

### Case 4: [Super Mario Maker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Maker)

- Players build all levels
- Players share all their creations, to be used by others
- ...Mario

Alright, so I chose these games not because they are a good sampling of successful games, but because I have various points to make and needed some backing evidence. Plus, these games are ones that I enjoy (well, not Minecraft, really) and have played (and of course have elements I will draw on when I start talking about the game I want to make, duh). The main quality that they all share is, of course, user creation and/or creativity. This is the crux of my game’s design.

First let’s talk about Warcraft III and its wonderful map editor that spawned the demon DotA. The game itself is a pretty good RTS and follow-up in the Warcraft franchise. But the map editor was something truly inspiring. I have spent countless hours - easily into the thousands{{% fnote %}}These kinds of numbers are actually quite countable... perhaps the saying should be: un-entertainingly countable. Although, I suppose without time machines and the ability to remember everything perfectly, the total amount of hours is unknown and therefore uncountable. Is uncountable == countless?{{% /fnote %}} - playing custom maps made by randoms across the realms. Maybe genres such as Turret Defense, Aeon of Strife (predecessor to [MOBAs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplayer_online_battle_arena) like DotA), and Changeling/Cat-and-Mouse (plus many more) existed before Blizzard’s map editors. But I think the plethora of games created by this community definitely mainstreamed them, and the top-down (traditional [RTS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy)) view made for a great spectrum of different map styles.

I want to make a game that utilizes the power of the community.{{% fnote %}}And so starts the fall of the game before its own creation and forevermore the reliance on the community will generally be thought of as a *bad thing*. Thanks Douglas Adams.{{% /fnote %}} Lots of games are open to modding, some have built-in engines for creating user content, and others themselves are about building and creating things (within the confines of the game itself). Enter ModCraft, the intersection of all of these ideas into a single, beautiful game.

The steps of development for this game follows:

1. We - the developers - will create an engine (like WC3 map editor) for players to easily create custom content.

2. You - the modding community - will help us with this endeavor right from the get-go. We want to involve the community as much as possible.

3. We will focus the game engine specifically toward creating sandbox-type worlds, allowing anything to be possible.

4. You will create whatever textures, models, etc. you want to interact with. Even procedural generation and specific algorithms for pathing will be open to the community to create.

5. We will control the sharing and releasing of mods and even pull in especially great mods into the actual codebase!

6. We will eventually open up most of the code for the community, and simply control what comes in and goes out.

7. We will create a marketplace for user content and give a sliver of the profits to the content creators.

8. We will not even work on anything, simply stealing everyone else’s contributions to make money for ourselves so we can make huge lakes of gold coins to dive in and swim through like Scrooge McDuck.

9. The game will be a great success, thanks to you all, the grand community!

Doesn’t this sound amazing? I truly believe that ModCraft is not only possible to pull off but a very lucrative venture for the few of us that get in at the ground-floor. People will be throwing money at us! Also, with any luck, we will have a whole host of new games created for us that we can play at the next LAN party, just like we did back in the good ol’ days.

Some fleshing out of these ideas may be necessary… which is why this is a multiple-part series. Stay tuned for part 2!

Cheers,

Panarchus
